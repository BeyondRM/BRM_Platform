/**
 * The platform's window controls. This singleton class allows defining various windows and components in a system-wide
 * manner.
 * <p/>
 * With this module, we wish to allow customizing of the window-skins for our game-system. The "skin" is essentially an
 * image collection that can be parsed and applied to various visual elements of a game's interface. This includes some
 * images for decoration (fancy borders and backgrounds) of windows and components, "image fonts" from parsed graphics,
 * and a few other goodies.
 * <h1>How It Works.</h1>
 * This class holds a few lists and arrays of control definitions and window layouts that are serialized from encrypted
 * binary files. These are loaded and validated when the game initializes, and any error should be caught before a game
 * is underway.
 * <h2>PlatformWindowControls Index.</h2>
 * The index file, as in each module's decryption method, defines the various metadata and element attributes. Version,
 * update URL, and various other things may be stored in the index.
 * <h2>Window and Control Skins.</h2>
 * This window skin definition is initialized by reading a binary-encoded definition of the window system, the defaults
 * for the graphical system as a whole, and the images that are used for the components. Component graphics are parsed,
 * providing a visual element's background graphic, and any component decorations. This includes any window borders and
 * highlights that give the visual component a little appeal.
 * <p/>
 * Windows are a "container"-type component that can hold multiple child components in a complex layout. While drawing,
 * the container will iteratively draw each element contained within it.
 * <h2>Custom Graphical Fonts.</h2>
 * While we can still use the known "TrueType" fonts for text, we also can supply customized fonts from graphic images,
 * in a form that can be parsed for each letter-graphic. A game-system can have as many graphical fonts as is necessary
 * to give it an appealing display of text.
 * <p/>
 * On one hand, we have the tile-sheet of font characters, to be parsed into individual characters. This is easy enough
 * to do at engine-initialization, without much extra processor-overhead. On the other hand, each font also has a file,
 * encoded with the layout for each character in the font, such as "letter kerning" &mdash; the character width and how
 * much space to place between characters, whether to use shadow-effects, highlights, coloring, and other properties.
 * <p/>
 * The module that handles messages and textual layout can then use the above to make composite graphical lines of text
 * and then display them.
 * <h2>Additional Things.</h2>
 * The additional "goodies" may include combined window components (such as the "party gold" layout of visual elements)
 * that can themselves be used in other windows or visual layouts. It is meant to simplify the development of beautiful
 * menu screens, screen overlays, and general visual layout.
 * <p/>
 * In many of the traditional "RPG Maker"-branded games, the window layouts could possibly contain visual parts easily
 * defined in common and shared across one or more "window" elements. A prime example might be a hero's HP, MP, and TP,
 * all attributes that each character could be displaying.
