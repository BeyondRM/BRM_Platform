  Defines the various equipment slots and equippable options for this race.

  This may be useful for many purposes; the primary one being, a non-humanoid may not have the limbs or body structures
  that a humanoid does, and so may literally not be able to equip certain classes of armor or weapons. For example, for
  a sentient bear-like race that grow spiky projections over the body, typical nonmetal armor would be punctured, metal
  armor would be somewhat difficult to wear or just unwieldy due to working around the spikes; footwear or headwear are
  one example of this.

  On the other hand, allowing this to be an editable list means a larger race might have or require more equipment slot
  mounting-points; in the above example, if the sentient bear race did not have spikes, it may perhaps require three or
  four times as much body-armor due to their size &mdash; but because of their size, weight, or general musculature, an
  individual of this race just might be able to handle such as easily as a human villager would wear cotton clothing.

  <race-equipment-slots>

    <!--
    The individual slot definition, that controls which object type goes in this slot, as well as which object subtypes
    may be preferred or not-allowed (equippable objects that are sub-types of the slot's type are assumed automatically
    allowed).

    This node also records an ordinal index, whether the slot is locked, the equipment type, sub-type attributes (which
    sub-types are disallowed and preferred), and usage dependency (for controlling enabled or visibility state).

    The ordinal index exists so that proper ordering of the individual slots are maintained, both in the editor, and in
    the game. Generally, this order will go something like this: headwear, bodywear, footwear, accessories, miscellany.
    (In other words, from "top" to "bottom".) But custom-named slot types may be put in an order that makes sense for a
    member of the race; for a sentient horse-ish species like a satyr, equippable points include headwear, chest armor,
    maybe a piece that covers where the torso meets the horse-body, and the remaining armor pieces are the same as for
    historical war-horses in Earth's cultures of the past (Google images of horse armor to see what that entails).

    For minimal considerations, the above listed slot-types (head, body, foot, accessory) may be all that is necessary;
    strategy-RPG games like Suikoden II contain them, though a game may allow for multiple accessory-type slots to hold
    active-use consumables and equipment for combat.

    For another example, the Lamia species, havng snake-like features, requires a lot of flexibility for ground motion;
    her armor pieces would need to be smaller inter-connecting fragments that do not hinder normal movement. The "above
    the waist" portions of a Lamia's body should be presumed similar to a human's, often a human female (as shown among
    other media featuring Lamia, like the MGQ game series, whether or not they are opponents to the main character).

    Specifying sub-types of armor or equipment that a slot can hold is important; a smallish halfliing individual would
    be able to wear "light armor" because it is more lightweight, and perhaps sometimes armor a bit more medium-weight,
    depending upon Strength. The sentient bear race, on the other hand, would be able to wear any weight of armor, but
    might find little use in wearing the lighter-weight equips due to their inherent mass and the battle damage they do
    or receive.

    A final attribute is 'use-depends-on', for defining that the existence of a slot is variable, or depends on certain
    generic or specific value of something. The aforementioned sentient bear race might be, alongside being the party's
    brawler class, the party's heavy-lifter, extending the maximum number or weight of inventory objects; an individual
    of the race might have a conditionally-enabled slot for holding an inventory container which holds specialty items.
    Another use might be for class-based requirements, such as a healer might have a Healer's Pouch, for containing any
    relevant herbs, medicines, surgical tools, whatever may be required.

    The dependency can specify the individual's class, or could be a specific variable value, like a boolean condition.

  aspects of a game, such as game events.
